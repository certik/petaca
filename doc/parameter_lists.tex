%%% THE ABSTRACT GOES HERE
A parameter list is a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection
of parameter name/value pairs.  A value can be a scalar or array of arbitrary
type, or a parameter list itself.  Parameter lists are intended as a convenient
way to pass information between different software layers.  The module
\texttt{parameter_list_type} implements the data structure and basic methods
for working with it, and the module \texttt{parameter_list_json}
provides additional procedures for parameter list input/output using
JSON-format text.

\section{Introduction}
A parameter list is a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection
of parameter name/value pairs.  A value can be a scalar or array of arbitrary
type, or a parameter list itself.  In the latter case we regard the parameter
as a sublist parameter.  Parameter lists are used to pass information between
different software layers.  Long argument lists can be shortened by gathering
some of the arguments into a parameter list and passing it instead.  Sublists
can be used for arguments intended to be passed in lower-level calls, and so
forth.  While a parameter list can be populated through a sequence of calls
to define its parameters, it can also be defined using JSON text from an input
file, and therein lies its real power.  If JSON is used to express text input,
parameter lists provide a powerful and flexible means for easily disseminating
that input throughout the entire software stack.

Parameter lists are intended to pass lightweight data: scalars or (very)
small arrays, typically of intrinsic primitive types.  Values of arbitrary
derived type can be used but great caution must be used when doing so
because the get/set methods make shallow copies of the value; see
\emph{Limitation on values} below.  Also such values cannot be input/output
using JSON-format text.

This implementation is inspired by, and modeled after, the
\texttt{Teuchos::ParameterList} C++ class from Trilinos
(\URL{http://trilinos.sandia.gov}).

\section{The parameter_list derived type}
The derived type \texttt{parameter_list} implements the parameter list data
structure.  It has the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assignment is defined for \texttt{parameter_list} variables with the
  expected semantics.  The lhs parameter list is first deleted, and then
  defined with the same parameters and values as the rhs parameter list,
  becoming an independent copy of the rhs parameter list; but see
  \emph{Limitation on values} below.
\item
  The structure constructor \texttt{parameter_list()} evaluates to an
  empty parameter list, and \texttt{parameter_list} variables come into
  existence as empty parameter lists.
\item
  \texttt{Parameter_list} objects are properly finalized when they are
  deallocated or otherwise cease to exist.
\end{itemize}

The derived type has the following type bound procedures.  Some have the
optional intent-out arguments \texttt{stat} and \texttt{errmsg}.  If the
integer \texttt{stat} is present, it is assigned the value 0 if no error
was encountered; otherwise it is assigned a non-zero value.  In the latter
case, the allocatable deferred-length character string \texttt{errmsg},
if present, is assigned an explanatory message.  If \texttt{stat} is not
present and an error occurs, the error message is written to the preconnected
error unit and the program terminates.

\subsection{Type bound subroutines}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[\texttt{set(name, value \Lbr,stat \Lbr,errmsg\Rbr\Rbr)}]
  sets the value of the parameter with name \texttt{name} to \texttt{value},
  which may be a scalar or rank-1 array of any type.  A copy of the passed
  value, as created by sourced allocation, is stored in the parameter list
  and thus caution should be exercised with derived type values; see
  \emph{Limitations on values} below.  The parameter need not exist before
  the call.  If it does, it must not be a sublist parameter and its existing
  value must have the same rank as \texttt{value}, but not necessarily the
  same type; its value is overwritten with \texttt{value}.
\item[\texttt{get(name, value \Lbr,default\Rbr\ \Lbr,stat \Lbr,errmsg\Rbr\Rbr)}]
  retrieves the value of the parameter \texttt{name} in the argument
  \texttt{value}.  This is a generic subroutine depending on the type and rank
  of \texttt{value}.  The allowed possibilities for \texttt{value} are:
  \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \item a scalar variable of logical, integer, or real type.
  \item an allocatable rank-1 array of logical, integer, or real type.
  \item an allocatable deferred-length character variable, either scalar
    or rank-1 array.  The allocated character length will be that of the
    longest string; others will be left justified.
  \item an allocatable \texttt{class(*)} scalar or rank-1 array.
  \end{itemize}
  The first three cases cover the most typical use cases.  The logical and
  integer types are of the default kind, while the real kind is \texttt{int64}
  from the intrinsic \texttt{iso_fortran_env} module (typically the same as
  double precision).  The final case is the most general and covers all use
  cases, but requires the application code to use the select-type construct
  in order to make use of the returned value.
  
  The optional argument \texttt{default} is allowed in the first three cases.
  It must have the same type and rank as \texttt{value}. If the named parameter
  does not exist, it is created with the value prescribed by \texttt{default}
  and that value is returned in \texttt{value}.

  It is an error if the named parameter does not exist and \texttt{default}
  is not present.  It is an error if the named parameter is a sublist.
  It is an error if the type and rank of \texttt{value} does not match the
  stored value of the named parameter.  Note that a \texttt{class(*)}
  \texttt{value} will match any parameter value.
\item[\texttt{print(unit, prefix)}]
  writes the parameter list in a readable format to the logicald unit
  \texttt{unit}.  \texttt{Prefix} is a character string that is used
  for indentation.  Successive levels of parameter lists are indented
  with multiple copies of \texttt{prefix}; it should usually be a string
  of blanks, such as \texttt{"  "}.  This method may be retired in favor
  of \texttt{parameter_list_to_json}; consider using it instead.
\end{description}

\subsection{Type bound functions}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[\texttt{sublist(name \Lbr,stat \Lbr,errmsg\Rbr\Rbr)}]
  returns a \texttt{type(parameter_list)} pointer to the named parameter
  sublist.  The parameter is created with an empty sublist value if it
  does not already exist.  It is an error if the parameter exists but is
  not a sublist.
\item[\texttt{is_parameter(name)}]
  returns true if there is a parameter with name \texttt{name};
  otherwise it returns false.
\item[\texttt{is_sublist(name)}]
  returns true if there is a sublist parameter with name \texttt{name};
  otherwise it returns false.
\end{description}

\subsection{Limitation on values}
This implementation uses the \texttt{map_any} derived type to store the
parameter name/value pairs.  The values stored in that data structure are
copies of the values passed to the \texttt{set} method, but they are shallow
copies as created by sourced allocation.  For intrinsic types these are
genuine copies.  For derived type values, the literal contents of the object
are copied, which for a pointer component means that a copy of the pointer
is made but not a copy of the target; the original pointer and its copy will
have the same target.  This also applies to parameter list assignment.
Thus great caution should be used when using values of derived types that
contain pointer components, either directly or indirectly.

\section{The parameter_list_iterator derived type}
Parameter values can be accessed in a parameter list directly, but only if
the parameter names are known.  The derived type
\texttt{parameter_list_iterator} provides a means of iterating through
the parameters in a \texttt{parameter_list} object; that is, sequentially
visiting each parameter in the list once and only once.  Once initialized,
a \texttt{parameter_list_iterator} object is positioned at a particular
parameter of its associated parameter list, or at a pseudo-position
\emph{the end}, and can be queried for the name and value of that parameter. 

Scalar assignment is defined for \texttt{parameter_list_iterator} objects.
The lhs iterator becomes associated with the same parameter list as the rhs
iterator and is positioned at the same parameter.  Subsequent changes to one
iterator do not affect the other.

An iterator is initialized via assignment, normally using a rhs that is
a structure constructor expression (see below).

\subsection{Constructors}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[\texttt{parameter_list_iterator(plist \Lbr,sublists_only\Rbr)}]
  evaluates to an iterator positioned at the initial parameter the parameter
  list \texttt{plist}, or the end if no parameters exist.  If the optional
  argument \texttt{sublists_only} is present with value true, parameters other
  than sublists are skipped by the iterator.
\end{description}

\subsection{Type bound subroutines}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[\texttt{next()}]
  advances the iterator to the next parameter in the list, or to the end if
  there are no more parameters remaining to be visited.  This call has no
  effect if the iterator is already positioned at the end. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Type bound functions}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[\texttt{at_end()}]
  returns true if the iterator is positioned and the end; otherwise it
  returns false.
\item[\texttt{name()}]
  returns the name of the current parameter.  The iterator must not be
  positioned at the end.
\item[\texttt{value()}]
  returns a \texttt{class(*)} pointer to the value of the current parameter.
  The iterator must not be positioned at the end.
\item[\texttt{is_list()}]
  returns true if the current parameter value is a sublist; otherwise it
  returns false.  The iterator must not be positioned at the end.
\item[\texttt{sublist()}]
  returns a \texttt{type(parameter_list)} pointer that is associated with
  the current parameter value if it is a sublist; otherwise it returns a
  \texttt{null()} pointer.
\item[\texttt{count()}]
  returns the number of remaining parameters, including the current one.
\end{description}

\section{Parameter list input/output using JSON}

JSON is a widely-used data format (\URL{http://www.json.org}).  It is
lightweight, flexible, and easy for humans to read and write---characteristics
that make it an ideal format for data interchange.  A parameter list whose
values are of primitive intrinsic types can be represented quite naturally
as JSON text that conforms to a subset of the JSON format:
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item
  A parameter list is represented by a JSON \emph{object}, which is an
  unordered list of comma-separated \emph{name}\texttt{:}\emph{value}
  pairs enclosed in braces (\texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}}).
\item
  A parameter name and value are represented by a
  \emph{name}\texttt{:}\emph{value} pair of the object:
  \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \item
    A \emph{name} is a string enclosed in double quotes.
  \item
    A \emph{value} may be a string (in double quotes), an integer, a real
    number, or a logical value (literally \texttt{true} or \texttt{false},
    not the Fortran constants).
  \item
    A \emph{value} may be also be a JSON \emph{array}, which is an ordered
    list of comma-separated \emph{values} enclosed in brackets (\texttt{[}
    and \texttt{]}).  To represent an array parameter value, the values in
    a JSON array are limited to scalars of the same primitive type.
    JSON would allow array values of
    different types and even general JSON values (object and array).
  \item
    A \emph{value} may also be a JSON object which is interpreted as a
    parameter sublist.
  \item
    Null values (\texttt{null}) are not allowed.
  \item
    0-sized arrays are not allowed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Comments (starting from \texttt{//} to the end of the line) are allowed;
  this is an extention to the JSON standard that is provided by the YAJL
  library that performs the actual parsing of the JSON text.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{parameter_list_json} module provides the following procedures
for creating a parameter list object from JSON text and for producing a JSON
text representation of a parameter list object.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[\texttt{call parameter_list_from_json_stream (unit, plist, errmsg)}]
  reads JSON text from the logical unit \texttt{unit}, which must be
  connected for unformatted stream access, and creates the corresponding
  parameter list, as described above.  The intent-out \texttt{type(parameter_list)}
  pointer argument \texttt{plist} returns the created parameter list.  An
  unassociated return value indicates an error condition, in which case the
  allocatable deferred-length character argument \texttt{errmsg} is assigned
  an explanatory error message.
\item[\texttt{call parameter_list_to_json (plist, unit)}]
  writes the JSON text representation of the parameter list \texttt{plist}
  to \texttt{unit}, which must be connected for formatted write access.
  The parameter list values other than sublists must be of intrinsic primitive
  types that are representable in JSON: logical, integer, real, character.
